The aim of this project is to implement the checkshot theory to calibration well log data. Well data calibration plays a crucial role in seismic analysis by providing ground truth information to validate and refine seismic interpretations and models. It helps improve velocity models, characterize subsurface properties, validate seismic horizons and faults, and enhance reservoir characterization. The integration of well data and seismic data allows for a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of the subsurface, benefiting exploration, development, and production activities in the oil and gas industry.

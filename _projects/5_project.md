The aim of this project is to implement wavelet extraction methods to analyze wavelets from seismic data and well log data. In seismic processing, wavelet extraction refers to the process of estimating or deriving the wavelet used to represent seismic data. The wavelet is a mathematical function that serves as a prototype for seismic signals and is used in various processing steps, such as seismic inversion, deconvolution, and amplitude correction. The goal of wavelet extraction in seismic processing is to obtain an accurate representation of the wavelet that closely matches the seismic data characteristics.

I'm a software developer at CGG Services (Singapore) Pte Ltd. Previously, I received my Ph.D in Computer Science from Nanyang Technological University Singapore, where I was advised by Prof. Seah Hock Soon. I have extensive experiences in the field of computer grpahics, especially computational geometry and 2D animation. I have hand-on experience on commercial software development using C++ and Qt.

In my Ph.D study, my research focues on graphics technologies to improve the efficiency and quality in key frame-based animation process, including line drawing analysis, vector-based drawing painting, and occlusion handling. My research outcomes have been integrated as three tools into CACANi, a 2D vector-based animation application (https://cacani.sg/). 

After graduation, I joined CGG Services (Singapore) Pte Ltd as a software developer and am mainly responsible for the development of graphical applications for high-end seismic data processing. Specifically, application and modules for well data processing and interpretation.
